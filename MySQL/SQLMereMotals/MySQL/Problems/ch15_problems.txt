Sales Orders Database
----------------------
1. “Apply a 5 percent discount to all orders for customers who purchased more
than $50,000 in the month of October 2012.”
(Hint: You need a subquery within a subquery to fetch the order numbers
for all orders where the customer ID of the order is in the set of customers
who ordered more than $50,000 in the month of October.)

You can find the solution in CH15_Give_Discount_To_Good_October_Customers (650 rows changed).
Be sure to run CH15_Update_Order_Totals_Subquery to correct the totals in the Orders table after executing this query.

Solution:

UPDATE    Order_Details
SET              QuotedPrice = ROUND(QuotedPrice * .95, 2)
WHERE     OrderNumber in (... order numbers in orders on 10/12 > $50k....)

Step 1: Find all customers who purchased more than $50k in 10/2012

select o.CustomerID
from Orders as o join Order_Details as od
ON o.OrderNumber = od.OrderNumber
where (month(o.OrderDate) = 10) and year(o.OrderDate) = 2012
group by o.CustomerID
having SUM(od.QuotedPrice * od.QuantityOrdered) > 50000;
+------------+
| CustomerID |
+------------+
|       1006 |
|       1016 |
|       1017 |
|       1025 |
+------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)


Step 2: List all orders affected (made in october 2012 and > 50K)

select o.OrderNumber from Orders as o
where o.CustomerID in (select o1.CustomerID
                  from Orders as o1 join Order_Details as od
                  ON o1.OrderNumber = od.OrderNumber
                  where (month(o1.OrderDate) = 10) and year(o1.OrderDate) = 2012
                  group by o1.CustomerID
                  having SUM(od.QuotedPrice * od.QuantityOrdered) > 50000);
+-------------+
| OrderNumber |
+-------------+
|          58 |
|          79 |
|          81 |

....

|         918 |
|         925 |
|         936 |
+-------------+
150 rows in set (0.00 sec)


Step 3: Perform update

update Order_Details
set QuotedPrice = ROUND(QuotedPrice * .95, 2)
where OrderNumber in
( select o.OrderNumber from Orders as o
  where o.CustomerID in (select o1.CustomerID
                    from Orders as o1 join Order_Details as od
                    ON o1.OrderNumber = od.OrderNumber
                    where (month(o1.OrderDate) = 10) and year(o1.OrderDate) = 2012
                    group by o1.CustomerID
                    having SUM(od.QuotedPrice * od.QuantityOrdered) > 50000) );
